description: Action prediction focuses on anticipating actions before they happen. Recent works leverage probabilistic approaches to describe future uncertainties and sample future actions. However, these methods cannot easily find all alternative predictions, which are essential given the inherent unpredictability of the future, and current evaluation protocols do not measure a system's ability to find such alternatives. We re-examine action prediction in terms of its ability to predict not only the top predictions, but also top alternatives.
